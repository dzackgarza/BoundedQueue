Bounded Queue

In order to test the Bounded Queue class, you cacn find a jar in the ./out/artifacts/KPCB_jar directory.
You can run it with the following command:

java -jar KPCB.jar

(Note: while it was compiled with Java 1.8, it should work with any version.)



To see the implementation, look no further than the ./src directory!

There you'll find BoundedQueue.java, which contains the implentation and a discussion of algorithmic running time and memory considerations.
You can also review Main.java to find a few tests, and the guarantees that can be made as long as those tests are passed.
